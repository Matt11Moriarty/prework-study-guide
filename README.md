# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
This project was created as a way to present the things I have learned in the Prework, and present them in such a way that other students can view it.
In creating this study guide, I learned about the three main languages of web development:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
* as well as some Git!
I've gained a foundation and feel much more confident entering this bootcamp armed with my wonderful new study guide.
